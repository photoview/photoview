# Dependencies

This directory contains scripts and Dockerfile to build third-party dependencies for Photoview. It is not intended for end-users or runtime execution.

However, technically it is runnable for easy debug and investigation purposes.
It contains 1 archive file `artifacts.tar.gz` with all the dependencies inside.
To unpack it, you can use the `tar -xzf artifacts.tar.gz [-C /desired/location]` command.
