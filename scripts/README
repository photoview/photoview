All scripts should be run from the root of the repo, like:

```
$ pwd
xxxxx/photoview
$ ./scripts/up_database.sh
$ ./scripts/compose.sh run -it api /bin/bash
...
$ ./scripts/test_with_coverage.sh
$ ./scripts/clean.sh
```

- clean.sh: clean files under `./dev`, and stop databases.
- install_build_dependencies.sh: install API dependencies for building.
- set_compiler_env.sh: setup the compiler variables for building API.
