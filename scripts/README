All scripts should be run from the root of the repo, like:

```
$ pwd
xxxxx/photoview
$ ./scripts/up_database.sh
$ ./scripts/compose.sh run -it api /bin/bash
...
$ ./scripts/test_api.sh mysql -- [-v] [-database -p 1] [-filesystem]
$ ./scripts/down_database.sh
```

To develop, run `api` and `ui` server first:

```
$ ./scripts/compose.sh run api
$ ./scripts/compose.sh run ui
```

Change codes and rerun commands above.

- For developing:
  - compose.sh: run `docker compose -f dev-compose.sh`. It accepts parameters after `docker compose`.
  - up_database.sh: launch mysql and postgres in the background.
  - down_database.sh: stop databases and clean files under `./dev`.
- For building:
  - set_compiler_env.sh: setup the compiler variables for building API.
  - install_build_dependencies.sh: install API dependencies for building.
- For testing:
  - test_api.sh: test API with proper database environment.
