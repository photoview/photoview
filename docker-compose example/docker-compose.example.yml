  ## Uncomment the `postgres-autoupgrade` service if you want to upgrade PostgreSQL automatically, or follow the
  ## official PostgreSQL upgrade guide https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html manually.
  ## Don't forget to uncomment the 3 `depends_on` lines in the `postgres` service.
  ## This service will upgrade the PostgreSQL database to the version, specified in the `image` tag.
  ## Read more on the https://hub.docker.com/r/pgautoupgrade/pgautoupgrade
  ## Tip: Back up the Photoview data before autoupgrade to a new PostgreSQL version.
  ## It is an optional service to simplify the upgrade process. You can also upgrade PostgreSQL manually.
  ## It is safe to keep it enabled, as if it detects no upgrade is needed, it exits immediately.
