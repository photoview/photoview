      ## A token can be generated for free here https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
      ## It's a good idea to limit the scope of the token to your own domain, to prevent others from using it.

      ## Change This in the .env file: to the directory where your photos are located on your server.
      ## You can mount multiple paths if your photos are spread across multiple directories.
      ## The same path as the container path set here, you'll need to provide on the Photoview's init page (the one between the ':' chars).
      ## If you mount several folders, provide the path to the parent one on the init page.
      ## If you mount several folders, make sure that there are no direct mappings to the media root folder.
      ## This means that you need to also modify the container path of the HOST_PHOTOVIEW_MEDIA_ROOT
      ## to something like '/photos/main'. Note that this new name ('main' in this example) will become an album in Photoview.
      - "${HOST_PHOTOVIEW_MEDIA_ROOT}:/photos:ro"
      ## *Additional* media folders can be mounted like this (set the variable in .env file)
      ## Note that a mount cannot be located in a subfolder of another mount.
